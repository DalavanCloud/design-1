### Product and Design Contributions

You can contribute to the product direction and user interface in a few ways
 1. Comment on an [existing issue in the backlog](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). Add your thoughts, add an alternate idea or add a relevant reference elsewhere on the web.
 2. Tackle one of the issues labeled ["Needs definition"](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/labels/needs%20definition) or ["Design"](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/labels/design).  Needs defintion means it needs more detail and direction.  Needs design means it needs an interface layout or interaction. Any fidelty of design is fine from a hand-drawn sketch to a wireframe or a mockup.
 3. Write a feature request in the webcompat.com repo. [Read how](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-requests).

### Design mockups

We store design documentation and artifacts in this repo (the design repo).  Many of the files were made [using Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).  

Some older files were made with [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), Adobe [Illustrator or Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html).

If you're interested in contributing to the design of the site, check out [the milestones](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/milestones).  (Ignore the dates, they are meant to indicate priority.)  You can see what's up next there and add your perspective with a comment or a sketch. 

### Pattern Library

We try to keep up with the interface patterns we have developed in the [Pattern Portfolio](http://webcompat.github.io/webcompat.com/).  

It always needs updating and rethinking.

### Design Review

Discussion about designs happens in the [Webcompat.com repository](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues).  

Feel free to jump in with some thoughts or an alternate design idea.
