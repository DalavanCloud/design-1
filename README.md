### Product and Design Contributions

You can contribute to the product direction and user interface: 
 1. Comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22scope%3A+design%22). Add your thoughts, add an alternate idea / design or add a relevant reference elsewhere on the web.
 
 2. If you'd like to add a new idea for a feature or improvement, but can't find anything under the [existing issues](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22scope%3A+design%22), please create [a new issue](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat.com/issues/new) and describe your idea in there, add relevant references or even a design, if you have anything specific in mind, you'd love to work on. 

### Design mockups

We store design documentation and artifacts in this repo (the design repo).  
The files were made [using Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).  


### Pattern Library

We try to keep up with the interface patterns we have developed in the [Pattern Portfolio](http://webcompat.github.io/webcompat.com/). It always needs updating and rethinking.

Right now we have a big refactor in front of us and will move to a living style guide very soon.
